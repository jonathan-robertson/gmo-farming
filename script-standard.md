# Script

1. This is a quick introduction to the GMO Farming Mod; a download link for this mod is included in the video description.
2. New skill levels have been added to the Living off the Land Perk
   1. [go to living off the land skill]
3. Levels 4 and 5 become available at Fortitude 7 and 10, respectively
4. Level 3 unlocks a new workstation called the "Hot Box"
   1. [go to hot box]
      1. You can use the Hot Box to Enhance Seeds.
         1. [select an enhanced seed and show details tab]
         2. Enhancing a Seed will double its crop yield.
         3. But keep in mind that Enhanced Plants will NOT have a 50% chance to drop a seed in the way that natural plants do.
   2. [go to first trait tab]
      1. At level 4, you can add your first trait to any Enhanced Seeds you've crafted
   3. [go to second trait tab]
      1. And at level 5, you can add a second trait to a seed that already has its first trait.
      2. The recipe list here is quite long to cover all supported trait combinations, but I think the easiest way to navigate would be to select a seed and click the recipe link. This filters the recipes to show only those that require this seed. Or put a different way: only those traits you can add to this seed.
5. [leave hotbox and go to hidden traits demo]
   1. Some traits operate like traps, so displaying any traits in the display text would be self-defeating
   2. [show stage 3 and stage 2, then stage 1]
   3. We do, however, still show the traits in the seedling stage to provide some sanity for a farmer in the process or organizing his land for the first time.
   4. As you can see from the name, this pumpkin is explosive.
   5. [jump onto seedling pumpkin]
   6. Trap traits only go into effect in the final stage of growth
   7. [walk one block at a time onto the stage 3 pumpkin]
   8. You may also have noticed that the explosion delay after tripping the trigger is far shorter than for mines - this is intentional and can be used to effectively trap roads or other environments you expect players to be sprinting/riding through.
   9. You'll also notice that the stage 2 pumpkin is left undamaged. This is also intentional: explosive plants do no damage to the blocks around them and instead only produce entity damage for players, zombies, and animals.
   10. One can trigger this explosion only by contact, melee, or arrows.
   11. It's very important to note that Bullets do not trigger explosions for these explosive plants since their explosive components are fully buried.
   12. Just like normal mines, grenades or other explosives only have a 33% chance to trigger explosive plants.
   13. Doubling up on the Explosive trait will produce Extremely Explosive Plants. The damage and range of the explosion will be larger as a result, but will still do no damage to surrounding blocks or crops.
6. [start moving through the corn, then turn around and look at the corn]
   1. Thorny Plants will trigger a damage over time effect that continues for as long as one remains within the crops' area.
   2. Just like Explosive Plants, Thorny Plants will damage any kind of player, zombie, or animal wandering within.
   3. Doubling up on the Thorny trait will produce Extra Thorny Plants. This type of plant will damage entities at an even faster rate.
7. [walk to the renewable plant]
   1. Renewable Plants will automatically re-plant themselves just like they did in A19.
   2. Note that one can still pickup a plant in the first or second stage to receive the seed for that plant. This is still true for Renewable Plants as well.
8. [walk to the bonus table]
   1. Bonus Plants produce extra crop yield and doubling up on the Bonus Trait will produce Bountiful Bonus Plants.
   2. The crop yield range is shown below for each plant
9. [walk into the base]
   1. Many people don't know this, but plants can actually grow inside as long as they're close enough to hatches or doors. Light levels leak through these blocks very slightly, but growth rate will be negatively impacted (notice the pink wireframe to indicate this)
   2. [start going down the hatch]
   3. Roughly 15 blocks away from any doors/hatches/glass, one will completely lose the ability to even plant typical seeds, but mushrooms still work without any trouble.
   4. [demonstrate with normal seed showing red wireframe]
   5. Applying the Underground Trait will enhance any plant to no longer require sunlight to plant or grow at full speed.
10. [center undergrown crops]
    1. On the topic of growth rate: one other Trait we haven't discussed is Fast Growth. Applying this once will reduce the required growth time by half. Applying it again will transform the trait to Rapid Growth and this will cut down the required growth time by 3/4ths.
11. [access nearby hotbox]
    1. We've discussed the Standard Edition of GMO Farming and this was designed primarily to expand content to the base game and enhance creativity in farming. Many of these traits are very powerful and you might be concerned that this mod could make things too easy for the player.
    2. The Researcher Edition seeks to address this concern by treating these new Traits and capabilities as challenges to unlock rather than skills the player mysteriously learns by applying skill points. We'll go into greater detail on that Edition in another video and you can find a link to it in the video description on YouTube, or in the README that comes packaged with this mod.
12. We hope the GMO Farming mod enhances the farming and gaming experience for you and your players.
