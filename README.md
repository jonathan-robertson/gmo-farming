## Compatibility

This modlet is compatible with Servers and Clients in all combinations; examine the chart below for details specific to your situation:

Environment | Compatible? | Details
:---: | :---: | ---
Dedicated Server | Yes | This mod is meant for dedicated servers only
EAC | Yes | You can leave EAC enabled on your server and client
P2P | Yes | Peer-to-peer multiplayer games only require the **host** to install this mod
Local | Yes | Installing this mod on the client is fully supported for local games

## Features

*Have you ever wanted to customize your seeds so they can meet your personal needs?*

### Seed Enhancement

With the help of a new workstation (the Hot Box), you'll expose seeds to abnormally high levels of the zombie virus, doubling their crop yield and making them capable of taking on various special traits.

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bonus | further doubles crop yield (4x yield over unmodified crops)
Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive [comparable to cooking pot mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives
Fast | reaches maturity in half the time
Renewable | clean, healthy water allows this plant to spread out its roots and bolster its nutrition absorption and allowing it to produce crops endlessly
Thorny | integrates with sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed
Underground | fused with mushroom dna, allowing growth without the need for sunlight

#### Trait Compatibility Matrix

Traits can also be combined (up to 2), though not all are compatible with one other.

|   | B | E | F | R | T | U |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| B | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| E | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | âœ… |
| F | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| R | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… |
| T | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| U | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« |

> *Note that Mushrooms cannot be given the Underground trait because they already have it.*

### Effects of Trait Combination

In situations where two different traits are adopted, the plant will benefit from each trait in equal measure.

But in situations where a trait is doubled, the name of the trait changes in the following ways:

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bountiful Bonus | further ***quadruples*** crop yield (***8x*** yield over unmodified crops)
Extremely Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive ***with a large payload*** [comparable to hubcap mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives
Rapid Growth | reaches maturity in a ***quarter*** of the time
Extra Thorny | integrates with ***many*** sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed ***profusely***

## 2 Different Themes to Choose From

This modlet comes with 2 Themes: `Standard` and `Researcher`. The one you choose for your game or community should be carefully considered.

You can download the Theme you prefer from our [Latest Release](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/gmo-farming/releases/latest) page by expanding the Assets link to see available downloads.

### `Standard` Experience

This Theme is the most vanilla-friendly experience you can expect from a mod like this:

- players unlock content by leveling up in `Living off the Land`
- each skill level the player adds after level 2 will unlock new content
- primary focus of this Theme is to encourage use and expand the base game's content

Fortitude Level Requirement | Living off the Land Level | Adjustment
:---: | :---: | ---
5 | 3 | In addition to the existing boost to crop yield, learn to craft a Hot Box (workstation) and Seed Enhancement
7 | 4 | Learn to add one trait into an Enhanced Seed
10 | 5 | Learn to add a second trait into a seed that already has its first trait

### `Researcher` Experience

This Theme is more focused on player specialization and giving the player a new challenge to overcome.

- instead of unlocking these new seed recipes by leveling up `Living off the Land`, the player unlock the *opportunity* to learn these new recipes by *researching* them (crafting schematics).
- such research is time and resource intensive, requiring intentional effort in working towards the player's desired seeds and traits. Naturally, this will be a challenge and require a significant amount of farming.
- primary focus of this Theme is to provide a difficulty barrier to crafting these new seeds. While the recipes to craft the seeds aren't complicated or challenging, researching them is and this requires players to invest the time if they want the benefit from these enhanced crops. This Theme is also an effort to prevent the GMO Farming mod from totally throwing the game out of whack with easy-to-craft super-crops

Fortitude Level Requirement | Living off the Land Level | Adjustment
:---: | :---: | ---
5 | 3 | In addition to the existing boost to crop yield, learn to craft a Hot Box (workstation) and Seed Enhancement ***Schematics***
7 | 4 | Learn the ***schematics*** to add one trait into an Enhanced Seed
10 | 5 | Learn the ***schematics*** to add a second trait into a seed that already has its first trait

## Recognition

- Huge recognition for Shavick who spent a lot of time brainstorming and proving out this concept with me!
  - His input into this project made most of its coolest ideas possible.
  - He plans to use this mod in his own Overhaul called Crystal Hell [(discord link)](https://discord.gg/xvSgfUJfsG); this mod is only a small piece if the awesome stuff they've got going on over there!
- Obviously The Fun Pimps for making a fun game to play and mod :]
