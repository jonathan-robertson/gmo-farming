7 Days to Die Modlet: Genetically modify seeds to grow plants with new properties

## Features

## Development

This modlet is truly massive due to all the plant variants and combinations of plant variants (up to 2 traits!). Becuase of this, we relied on Go to generate `blocks.xml`, `recipes.xml`, and more.

To make adjustments to generated files, feel free to edit `main.go` to suit your preferences. Then run `go run main.go` to have it dump files generated files into the `Config` folder.

## Learn Go

If you don't already know Go, you can learn it [over here](https://go.dev/learn/).

I highly recommend the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/), which can usually get someone up to speed in about 30mins to 1hr.
