## Summary

7 Days to Die Modlet: Genetically modify seeds to grow plants with new properties

[Standard Edition Introduction (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/Rlf7xDVKjIE) | [Researcher Edition Differences (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/4QvH_5q_P2g)

## Features

*Have you ever wanted to customize your seeds so they can meet your personal needs?*

### Seed Enhancement

Craft the **Hot Box** (a new workstation) to modify seeds with a variety of special traits!

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bonus | further doubles crop yield (4x yield over unmodified crops).
Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive [comparable to cooking pot mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. *Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives*.
Fast | plant reaches maturity in half the time.
Renewable | clean, fresh water allows this plant to spread out its roots and produce crops endlessly.
Thorny | integrates with sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed.
Underground | fused with mushroom dna, allowing growth without the need for sunlight.

#### Trait Compatibility Matrix

Traits can also be combined (up to 2), though not all are compatible with one other.

|   | B | E | F | R | T | U |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| B | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| E | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | âœ… |
| F | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| R | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… |
| T | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| U | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« |

> *Note that Mushrooms cannot be given the Underground trait because they already have it.*

### Effects of Trait Combination

In situations where two different traits are adopted, the plant will benefit from each trait in equal measure.

But in situations where a trait is doubled, the name of the trait changes in the following ways:

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bountiful Bonus | further ***quadruples*** crop yield (***8x*** yield over unmodified crops)
Extremely Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive ***with a large payload*** [comparable to hubcap mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives
Rapid Growth | reaches maturity in a ***quarter*** of the time
Extra Thorny | integrates with ***many*** sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed ***profusely***

## 2 Editions to Choose From

This modlet comes with 2 Editions: `Standard` and `Researcher`. The one you choose for your game or community should be carefully considered.

You can download the Edition you prefer from our [Latest Release](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/gmo-farming/releases/latest) page by expanding the Assets link to see available downloads.

### `Standard` Experience

[Standard Edition Introduction (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/Rlf7xDVKjIE)

This Edition is the most vanilla-friendly experience you can expect from a mod like this.

The primary focus of this Edition is to encourage use and expand the base game's content: just craft the `Hot Box` to get started.

### `Researcher` Experience

[Researcher Edition Differences (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/4QvH_5q_P2g)

This Edition is more focused on player specialization and giving the player a new challenge to overcome.

- instead of having immediate access to the new seed recipes, the player needs to *researching* the recipes by crafting schematics.
- such research is time and resource intensive, requiring intentional effort in working towards the player's desired seeds and traits. Naturally, this will be a challenge and require a significant amount of farming.
- primary focus of this Edition is to provide a difficulty barrier to crafting these new seeds. While the recipes to craft the seeds aren't complicated or challenging, researching them is and this requires players to invest the time if they want the benefit from these enhanced crops. This Edition is an effort to prevent the GMO Farming mod from totally throwing the game out of whack with easy-to-craft super-crops

### `Researcher Loot` Experience

This Edition is the same as Researcher with one major change: players will be able to find schematics in quest loot.

Tier | Enhanced Chance | Single Trait Chance | Double Trait Chance
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 0% | 0% | 0%
2 | 1% | 0% | 0%
3 | 5% | 1% | 0%
4 | 15% | 5% | 1%
5 | 25% | 15% | 5%

## Recognition

- Huge recognition for Shavick who spent a lot of time brainstorming and proving out this concept with me!
  - His input into this project made most of its coolest ideas possible.
  - He plans to use this mod in his own Overhaul called Crystal Hell [(discord link)](https://discord.gg/xvSgfUJfsG); this mod is only a small piece if the awesome stuff they've got going on over there!
- Obviously The Fun Pimps for making a fun game to play and mod :]
